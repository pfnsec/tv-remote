# tv-remote

This is a server which can be used to stream video to an rtmp server. It can then be remotely controlled from the tvRemote applcation in here, or the facebook bot application developed for it, available here: https://github.com/pfnsec/nefarious-man/blob/master/pogchamp.js

This server allows you to select shows, skip the current show, pause the current show, request new shows, toggle shuffle. Administrators can lock the skip, and retreive the show request list.
